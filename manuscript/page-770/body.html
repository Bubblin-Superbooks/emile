I may have at the same moment an idea of a big stick and a little stick without comparing them, without judging that one is less than the other, just as I can see my whole hand without counting my fingers. [Footnote: M. de le Cordamines’ narratives tell of a people who only know how to count up to three. Yet the men of this nation, having hands, have often seen their fingers without learning to count up to five.] These comparative ideas, ‘greater’, ‘smaller’, together with number ideas of ‘one’, two’, etc. are certainly not sensations, although my mind only produces them when my sensations occur.</p></div> </div>
