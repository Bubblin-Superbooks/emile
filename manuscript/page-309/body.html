<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">climates are the climate of Persia, but I did not choose a European pupil to turn him into an Asiatic.</p><p>Children are generally too much wrapped up, particularly in infancy. They should be accustomed to cold rather than heat; great cold never does them any harm, if they are exposed to it soon enough; but their skin is still too soft and tender and leaves too free a course for perspiration, so that they are inevitably exhausted by excessive heat. It has been observed that infant mortality is greatest in August. Moreover, it seems certain from a comparison of northern and southern races that we become stronger by bearing extreme cold rather than excessive heat. But as the childâ€™s body grows bigger and his muscles get stronger, train him gradually to bear the rays of the sun. Little by little you will harden him till he can face the burning heat of the tropics without danger.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Locke, in the midst of the manly and sensible advice</p></div> </div>
