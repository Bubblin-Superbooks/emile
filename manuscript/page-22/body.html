Our efforts may bring us within sight of the goal, but fortune must favour us if we are to reach it.</p><p>What is this goal? As we have just shown, it is the goal of nature. Since all three modes of education must work together, the two that we can control must follow the lead of that which is beyond our control. Perhaps this word Nature has too vague a meaning.
