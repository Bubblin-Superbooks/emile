It is thought that the expression is merely the development of certain features designed by nature. For my own part I think that over and above this development a manâ€™s face is shaped, all unconsciously, by the frequent and habitual influence of certain affections of the heart. These affections are shown on the face, there is nothing more certain; and when they become habitual, they must surely leave lasting traces.</p></div> </div>
