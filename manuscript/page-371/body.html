Their white skins were not meant to be hardened by blows and their faces were not made for bruises.

People always play carelessly in games where there is no danger. A falling kite hurts nobody, but nothing makes the arm so supple as protecting the head, nothing makes the sight so accurate as having to guard the eye. To dash from one end of the room to another, to judge the rebound of a ball before it touches the ground, to return it with strength and accuracy, such games are not so much sports fit for a man, as sports fit to make a man of him.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The childâ€™s limbs, you say, are too tender.
