This time yesterday we were observing the position of the forest from Montmorency. If only we could see the position of Montmorency from the forest.</p><p>EMILE. But yesterday we could see the forest, and here we cannot see the town.</p><p>JEAN JACQUES. That is just it. If we could only find it without seeing it.</p><p>EMILE. Oh! my dear friend!</p><p>JEAN JACQUES. Did not we say the forest was...</p><p>EMILE. North of Montmorency.</p><p>JEAN JACQUES. Then Montmorency must lie...</p><p>EMILE. South of the forest.</p><p>JEAN JACQUES. We know how to find the north at midday.</p><p>EMILE. Yes, by the direction of the shadows.</p></div> </div>
