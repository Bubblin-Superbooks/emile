<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">away upon children.</p><p>“Le renard s’en saisit, et dit, ‘Mon bon monsieur’” (The fox catches it, and says, “My dear sir”).—So kindness is already folly. You certainly waste no time in teaching your children.</p><p>“Apprenez que tout flatteur” (“You must learn that every flatterer”).—A general maxim. The child can make neither head nor tail of it.</p><p>“Vit au depens de celui qui l’ecoute” (“Lives at the expense of the person who listens to his flattery”).—No child of ten ever understood that.</p><p>“Ce lecon vaut bien un fromage, sans doute” (“No doubt this lesson is well worth a cheese”).—This is intelligible and its meaning is very good. Yet there are few children who could compare a cheese and a lesson, few who would not prefer the cheese. You will therefore have to make them understand that this is said in mockery. What subtlety for a child!</p></div> </div>
