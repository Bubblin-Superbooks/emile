<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>CHILD: He died. [Footnote: The child will say this because she has heard it said; but you must make sure she knows what death is, for the idea is not so simple and within the child’s grasp as people think. In that little poem “Abel” you will find an example of the way to teach them. This charming work breathes a delightful simplicity with which one should feed one’s own mind so as to talk with children.]</p><p>NURSE: Why did he die?</p><p>CHILD: Because he was so old.</p><p>NURSE: What becomes of old people!</p><p>CHILD: They die.</p><p>NURSE: And when you are old——?</p><p>CHILD: Oh nurse!
